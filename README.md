# Truck-Trackr


Truck-Trackr is an application that was created to help solve the business need of scheduling and coordination between local food trucks and breweries.  Previously, they used a Facebook page to manage this and it became really cumbersome to find the right information, especially with last minute cancellations.  Truck-Trackr allows food trucks and breweries to log in to their account,  manage their own calendar, and browse other food trucks and breweries availability.   

## Getting Started

This is a general guide to setting up Truck-Trackr on your local machine.

    git clone https://github.com/Haub/truck-trackr-fe.git

    cd truck-trackr-fe

    npm install

    npm start

## Testing
Truck-Trackr uses Jest and Enzyme for front-end testing.  Run `npm test` from the root directory.
