# Truck-Trackr[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Haub/truck-trackr-fe.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Haub/truck-trackr-fe)


Truck-Trackr is an application that was created to help solve the business need of scheduling and coordination between local food trucks and breweries.  Previously, they used a Facebook page to manage this and it became really cumbersome to find the right information, especially with last minute cancellations.  Truck-Trackr allows food trucks and breweries to log in to their account,  manage their own calendar, and browse other food trucks and breweries with filters for location and availability.   

See it live @ [Heroku](https://trucktrackr.herokuapp.com/)
